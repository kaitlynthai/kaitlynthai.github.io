  <h2> Stranger Things is one of my favorite shows of all time. I love how suspenseful and interesting it is, which makes it an AMAZING show to binge watch whenever I need something to do. In my opinion, the best season overall was season 3 because the show has improved by the saeasons. My favorite character in the show is Eleven because she has really grown as a person throughout the show and her powers make her SUPER cool! Even though the show can get scary at times, it always leaves me wanting more at the end of each episode AND season. Overall, I HIGHLY reccommend this show for all audiences, UNLESS you get scared easily or STRONGLY DISLIKE science fiction and children. :)
